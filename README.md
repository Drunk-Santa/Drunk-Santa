## Hi there 👋

Ah, Christmas can wait—what’s the rush, really? 

People act like I’m some magical time machine who has to hit every house in one night, but come on, I’m just a guy with a sleigh and way too many cookies. And you know what goes great with cookies? Whiskey. 

Sure, the elves are yelling about deadlines, but maybe they should try flying around the world in a snowstorm sometime. Besides, kids these days have enough toys—they’ll survive if I take a little “me” time. 

Let’s be honest, one missed Christmas won’t hurt anyone… right?
